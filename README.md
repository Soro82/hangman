## Introduction

The Hangman game is a Python command-line project. It is written in Python and deployed using Heroku. A word is picked at random and the user has seven chances to guess the correct letters in the word. The word is displayed with an underscore in place of each letter in the word.If the user guesses a correct letter, the underscore for that letter is replaced with the letter. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the next image of the hangman is displayed and the user is told how many lives they have left.
